# ============================================================

# This script is meant to take an SSH to the source repo in git
# Example of SSH: git@github.com:user/repository-name.git
# Example of SSH for server: userName@server.address.edu:~/path/to/repo

# Script takes an input argument for the repository you want to replay when called
# Example of call: ./p532-git-script.sh git@github.com:user/repository-to-replay.git
# Example of call for server: ./p532-git-script.sh server: userName@server.address.edu:~/path/to/repo

# NOTE: This repository will be reintialized and all commits from this repo will be erased before replay.
