# Source : git@github.com:asadana/GitReplay-bash-script.git

# This script is meant to take an SSH to the source repo in git
# Example of SSH: git@github.com:user/repository-name.git

# Script takes an input argument for the repository you want to replay when called
# Example of call: ./p532-git-script.sh git@github.com:user/repository-to-replay.git

# If condition simply checks if it's a valid SSH format
if [ ! -d $1/.git ]; then
    echo "$(basename $0): not a git directory." 1>&2
    exit 1
